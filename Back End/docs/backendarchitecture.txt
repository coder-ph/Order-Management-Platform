System Architecture Documentation
Overview
This document describes the architecture of our e-commerce platform, which follows a monolithic design pattern with clearly separated concerns. The system is structured to handle client requests through multiple layers, ensuring proper separation of responsibilities, maintainability, and scalability.
Architecture Components
Client Layer
Client: Represents the end-user application (web browser, mobile app, or other client applications)
Interacts with the system by making HTTP requests to the gateway
Network Layer
Gateway/Load Balancer: Serves as the entry point for all client requests
Distributes traffic across application instances
Provides initial request routing
Handles TLS termination and basic security filtering
Monolith Application
The core of the system is implemented as a monolithic application with the following layers:
Request Handling Layer
Router Layer: Manages URL routes and directs requests to appropriate controllers
Maps HTTP endpoints to controller methods
Handles route parameters and query strings
Middleware Layer: Processes requests before they reach the controllers
Handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and request validation
Modifies request/response objects as needed
Handlers Layer
Controllers: Receive requests from the router
Validate input data
Coordinate with services to fulfill requests
Format and return appropriate responses
Services: Implement core business logic
Execute domain-specific operations
Coordinate with repositories for data operations
Manage transactions and ensure data consistency
Repository: Abstracts database interactions
Provides methods for CRUD operations
Handles data mapping between application and database models
Encapsulates query logic
Server Services Layer
Utilities: Provides common functions used throughout the application
Helper methods
Formatting utilities
Common validation logic
Service Functions: Implements specific backend processes
Complex calculations
Third-party integrations
Business rule processing
Webhooks: Handles asynchronous callbacks from external systems
Payment provider notifications
Shipping status updates
Partner system integrations
Cron Jobs: Manages scheduled tasks
Periodic reports generation
Data cleanup operations
Automated inventory checks
Message Queues/Events: Facilitates asynchronous processing
Event publication and subscription
Task queueing for background processing
System-wide notifications
Data Layer
Database: Persistent storage for application data
Stores product, user, order, and store information
Supports ACID transactions
Maintains data integrity through constraints
Data Flow
Client makes a request to the system
Request passes through the gateway/load balancer
Router layer directs the request to the appropriate endpoint
Middlewares process the request (authentication, logging, etc.)
Controller receives the request and validates inputs
Service layer implements business logic
Repository layer handles data operations with the database
Response flows back through the layers to the client
Integration Points
External Services: Integrated through the service layer and webhooks
Background Processing: Managed through cron jobs and message queues
Data Access: Centralized through the repository layer
Design Considerations
Scalability: The gateway/load balancer allows horizontal scaling of the monolith
Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to maintain
Extensibility: New features can be added by extending existing layers
Migration Path: The architecture supports gradual migration to microservices if needed in the future
